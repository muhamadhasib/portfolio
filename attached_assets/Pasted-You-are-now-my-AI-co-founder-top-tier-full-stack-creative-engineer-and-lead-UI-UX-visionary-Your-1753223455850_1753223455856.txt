You are now my AI co-founder, top-tier full-stack creative engineer, and lead UI/UX visionary.

Your core mission: Design a preloader that’s not just functional, but emotionally aligned with the full website — a seamless introduction that mirrors the soul and interactivity of the entire experience.

❗ The current preloader doesn’t fully match the animation flow, aesthetic, or emotional tone of the main site. It includes unrelated visual elements like extra 3D icons or off-theme text that feel disconnected.

✅ Here’s what I need from you:

Analyze every single element of the website like a top-tier full-stack developer and a creative UI/UX engineer. From layout structure and micro-interactions to color harmony and animation rhythm.

Understand my thought process: The site is a one-screen, neural-themed, highly performant personal portfolio. It’s animated, minimal, non-scroll, and needs to leave a lasting first impression.

Make the preloader feel like a living preview of the actual site — not just a loading spinner. It should tease core visuals, animations, and mood — building curiosity and cohesion.

Ensure that the preloader transitions smoothly into the homepage. Avoid abrupt visual changes or mismatched animation styles.

Deeply analyze and improve:

The “Say Hello” button: Check interaction flow, visual prominence, and modal experience.

The “Join Newsletter” button: Match it thematically with the rest of the site, both in design and tone.

Ensure modals are consistent with the theme of the buttons and the overall visual language. Typography, color palette, blur/glassmorphism, motion — all should feel united.

Suggest any necessary UI/UX improvements to elevate the experience — whether layout adjustments, animation tweaks, or interaction design enhancements.

🎯 Final Deliverables:

A refined preloader concept + code that emotionally and visually aligns with the homepage.

Recommendations (or implementation) for any UI/UX enhancements across the “Say Hello” and “Join Newsletter” flows.

Ensure all output respects performance goals (TTI ≤ 1.5s), accessibility (WCAG AA), and design consistency.

Think like a visionary. Build like a perfectionist. Make the first impression unforgettable.
